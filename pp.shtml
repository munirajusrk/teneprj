                    </ul>
                    <h3>How Do We Use Your Email Address?</h3>
                    <p>Email addresses of our customers are rarely collected by us. Whenever collected, the email addresses are not verified by us. Submitting the email address is left to the discretion of our customer. The submitted email address is used for the sole purpose of enabling and improving the services to our customers by us and our partners.</p>
                    <h3>How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h3>
                    <p>We keep your personal information only so long as we need it to provide our services to you and fulfil the purposes described in this policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share your information with and who carries out services on our behalf. When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we’ll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can't identify you.</p>
                    <h3>How Do We Protect Your Information?</h3>
                    <p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to us or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by a breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>
                    <h3>Could my information be transferred to other countries?</h3>
                    <p>We are incorporated in India. Information collected via our apps, through direct interactions with you, or from use of our help services may be transferred from time to time to our offices or personnel, or to third parties, located throughout the world, and may be viewed and hosted anywhere in the world, including countries that may not have laws of general applicability regulating the use and transfer of such data. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, by using any of the above, you voluntarily consent to the trans-border transfer and hosting of such information.</p>
                    <h3>Is the information collected through our apps secure?</h3>
                    <p>We take precautions to protect the security of your information. We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use your information. However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including encryption systems. In addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies. Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty to protect your personal information, you agree that intentional misconduct will be the standards used to measure our compliance with that duty.</p>
                    <h3>Can I update or correct my information?</h3>
                    <p>The rights you have to request updates or corrections to the information that our apps collect depend on your relationship with us.</p>
                    <p>Customers have the right to request the restriction of certain uses and disclosures of personally identifiable information as follows. You can contact us in order to (1) update or correct your personally identifiable information, or (2) delete the personally identifiable information maintained about you on our systems (subject to the following paragraph), by cancelling your account. Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will have no effect on other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change or deletion. To protect your privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your account information at all times.</p>
                    <p>You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to us from our system. The need to back up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. Promptly after receiving your request, all personal information stored in databases we actively use, and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent reasonably and technically practicable.</p>
                    <p>If you are an end user and wish to update, delete, or receive any information we have about you, you may do so by contacting the organization of which you are a customer.</p>
                    <h3>Personnel</h3>
                    <p>If you are a worker or applicant, we collect information you voluntarily provide to us. We use the information collected for Human Resources purposes in order to administer benefits to workers and screen applicants.</p>
                    <p>You may contact us in order to (1) update or correct your information, (2) change your preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive from us, or (3) receive a record of the information we have relating to you. Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will have no effect on other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change or deletion.</p>
                    <h3>Sale of Business</h3>
                    <p>Sale of business cannot be ruled out by us. Sale of business would mean that the assets, including product and data, with personal information, may be handed over to the buyer. In case of the sale of our business, this policy shall be brought to the notice of the buyer. However, it would not be possible for us at this time to rule out modifications that the buyer shall make to this policy.</p>
                    <h3>Affiliates </h3>
                    <p>We may disclose information (including personal information) about you to our Corporate Affiliates. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Corporate Affiliate" means any person or entity which directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with eSAP INDIA, whether by ownership or otherwise. Any information relating to you that we provide to our Corporate Affiliates will be treated by those Corporate Affiliates in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, you should not engage with our app, or use our services. Continued use of the app, direct engagement with us, or following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy that do not significantly affect the use or disclosure of your personal information will mean that you accept those changes.</p>
                    <h3>Your Consent</h3>
                    <p>We've updated our Privacy Policy to provide you with complete transparency into what is being set when you visit our site and how it's being used. By using our apps, registering an account, you hereby consent to our Privacy Policy and agree to its terms.</p>
