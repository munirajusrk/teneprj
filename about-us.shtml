                    <h2 class="index-h2">OUR Story</h2>
                    <p>We began exploring the agri-tech industry in 2010. We started with Crop Health Management. Our intension was to assist an extension worker during diagnosis of crop health problems and prescribing solutions to the farmer. We got an opportunity to demonstrate the first prototype of our product to a team of agricultural scientists in 2011. The scientists wanted to test the system, which gave us the first break. We successfully deployed the system by the end of the same year. Later, we teamed up and started Tene in 2012.</p>
                    <p>We focused on Crop Health for the next few years. During this time, our product was adopted by four Agri Universities and tested. Ultimately, the State Government of Karnataka adopted the product in the name of eSAP. The implementation of eSAP is coordinated by the University of Agricultural Sciences, Raichur.</p>
                    <p>During 2014, we started a program called DESEE Force (= Digitally Empowered Self Employed Extension Force). Under this program, we worked on the capacity building of rural men and women to serve as extension service providers, essentially Crop Doctors. We partnered with NGOs, private companies and international organizations for the implementation of this program. We developed training modules and customised mobile applications for non-technical users.</p>
                    <p>Hundreds of youths were successfully trained under the program. The training modules and the mobile application was recently integrated into eSAP for implementation in Karnataka. Karnataka State Government has recently launched the Registered Agricultural Practitioners Program on the lines of the DESEE Force Model.</p>
                    <p>We brought in multiple products during 2023 like the Crop Input Tracking System and PesTesT. During 2024, we shall be launching one of the biggest agri platforms in the world called "Rootstock".</p>
